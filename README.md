# Olympic Medals Dashboard
This dashboard was part of a Fall 2023 homework assignment for DS3500 - Advanced Programming with Data at Northeastern University. Worked with @sahana-dhar to focus on backend dashboard building with `dash`. 

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the `dashboard.py` script.
3. Navigate to the web address printed by the script where the dashboard is hosted (ex. Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/).
4. Follow the instructions; select sports and countries to compare Olympic success from 1896 to 2016.
